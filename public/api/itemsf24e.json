Already premixed, there is no need to dilute the product. This makes the gel easy to pour and eliminates the possibility of different results due to variations in the local water. This product is designed to solve common installation problems such as silvering, loss of adhesion and even trapped debris. In addition, being thick and viscous allows the Gel to be sprayed on the car without dripping off or evaporating quickly.
