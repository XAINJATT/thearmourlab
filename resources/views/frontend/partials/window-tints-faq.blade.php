                                 Ceramic window tints use a layer of ceramic particles to reject
                                 heat and UV
                                 rays, making them superior in heat reduction without blocking

                                 Ceramic window tints have a high infrared heat rejection rate.

                                 they're especially effective at blocking the heat-producing

                                 selecting darker tints, as individual experiences can vary.
